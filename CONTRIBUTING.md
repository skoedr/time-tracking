# Contributing to TimeTrack

Thank you for wanting to contribute to TimeTrack! This document describes the
workflow for issues, pull requests, and local development.

> **Languages:** Repository documentation is English — new docs and changelog
> entries are written in English. Issues, PRs, and commit messages may be in
> **German or English**. Please keep code comments and variable names in
> **English**.

## Code of Conduct

By contributing you accept the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
Please report violations to `robin.wald@hotmail.de`.

## Reporting a bug / proposing a feature

- **Bug:** Use the [bug report template](./.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml).
  Please provide version, OS, and reproducible steps.
- **Feature:** Use the [feature request template](./.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.yml).
  Describe the problem first, then the proposed solution.
- **Question / discussion:** Please use
  [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/skoedr/time-tracking/discussions)
  instead of an issue.
- **Security vulnerability:** **No** public issue. See [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md).

## Local development

Requirements: **Node.js 20+**, **pnpm 10+**, Windows or macOS.

```powershell
pnpm install        # Dependencies + native Module bauen
pnpm dev            # Electron + Vite Dev-Server starten
pnpm test           # Vitest unit tests
pnpm typecheck      # tsc --noEmit für alle tsconfig*-Projekte
pnpm lint           # ESLint
pnpm build          # Production-Build (electron-builder, ohne Publish)
```

App data lands locally in `%AppData%\time-tracking\` (Windows) or
`~/Library/Application Support/time-tracking/` (macOS). You can safely back these
up or delete them during development.

### Tests and the native SQLite ABI

`better-sqlite3` is a native module and is built against the **Electron** ABI
during `pnpm install`, because the app needs it at runtime. A system Node cannot
load this binary. `pnpm test` solves this by starting Vitest via
`scripts/run-vitest.mjs` on the Electron binary in Node mode
(`ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1`) — the same solution as the MCP server
(`src/main/mcpLaunch.ts`). There is **no** second binary copy and **no**
rebuild before the test run; `pnpm dev` and the package builds keep
working.

A green run is therefore **0 skipped** across all Vitest projects. If you
instead see a three-digit skip count, the environment is broken — not the code.
There is deliberately no absolute test count here — it goes stale with every
PR and then reads like a defect; a silently shrinking suite is instead guarded
by `src/test/vitestProjects.test.ts`, which fails when a `*.test.ts(x)` file is
not covered by any Vitest project.

**If tests fail with `ERR_DLOPEN_FAILED` / `NODE_MODULE_VERSION`:**

1. Are you calling Vitest directly (`pnpm exec vitest`, IDE runner)? Then use
   `pnpm test`. Directly under system Node it cannot work.
2. Otherwise the binary is stale — usually because at some point
   `pnpm rebuild better-sqlite3` ran and replaced it with a Node-ABI build.
   **`pnpm install` does not fix this:** electron-builder remembers the
   built ABI in `node_modules/better-sqlite3/build/Release/.forge-meta` and
   skips the rebuild when the marker already matches — the file lies then.
   Force it:

   ```powershell
   pnpm exec electron-rebuild -f -w better-sqlite3
   ```

In short: please do **not** use `pnpm rebuild better-sqlite3`. It leaves an
app that can no longer open its own database, without any command
complaining about it.

## Pull request workflow

1. **Issue first** – except for very small fixes (typo, one-line bug).
   For larger features please reach consensus in the issue before you write
   code, so the PR does not have to be rejected.
2. **Branch convention:** `feat/v{X.Y}-{shortname}`, `fix/v{X.Y}-{shortname}`
   or `docs/v{X.Y}-{shortname}`. Example: `feat/v1.7-pdf-merge`.
3. **Small PRs.** One PR = one topic. Separate refactor and feature.
4. **Tests.** New logic in `src/main/` or `src/shared/` needs a
   Vitest test. Renderer-only changes (layout, styling) are fine without a test.
5. **Local checks before push:** `pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm test`.
6. **Conventional Commits** (see below).
7. **PR description:** What, why, how tested, screenshots/GIFs for UI.

### Conventional Commits

```
<type>(<scope>): <kurze Zusammenfassung>

[optionaler Body]
```

Allowed types:

| Type       | Purpose                             |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `feat`     | New user-visible feature            |
| `fix`      | Bug fix                             |
| `docs`     | Docs, README, plan files            |
| `chore`    | Build, dependencies, tooling        |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring without behavior change |
| `test`     | Add or improve tests                |
| `security` | Security-relevant change            |

Scope is optional but welcome (`csv`, `pdf`, `i18n`, `db`, `ipc`, …).

Examples:

- `feat(pdf): merge external timesheet pages into export (#42)`
- `fix(timer): stop drift after suspend/resume`
- `chore(deps): bump electron 39.0.1 -> 39.0.4`

## Style & architecture

- **TypeScript strict.** No `any` without justification.
- **Pure functions** in `src/shared/` – no Electron or DOM imports there.
- **DB migrations** are immutable. A new schema change = a new
  migration file in `src/main/migrations/` + bump the DB version.
- **i18n — mandatory since v1.8:** Every user-visible string **must** go through `useT()` /
  `t(key)` and have an entry in **both** locale files:
  `src/shared/locales/de.ts` (source of truth) and `src/shared/locales/en.ts`.
  Hardcoded German or English strings in JSX/TSX are a review blocker.
  Check with: `pnpm exec node scripts/find-untranslated.mjs`
- **No telemetry.** See [PRIVACY.md](./PRIVACY.md).

## i18n workflow

Since v1.8 all user-visible strings are bilingual (DE/EN). This pattern is
**mandatory** for every new UI change:

```typescript
// In Components / Views — Hook holen:
import { useT } from '../contexts/I18nContext'
const t = useT()

// Verwendung:
t('some.key')                          // einfacher String
t('some.key', { variable: value })    // Interpolation: Key enthält {variable}

// Wenn t an eine Hilfsfunktion weitergegeben wird:
import type { TFunction } from '../contexts/I18nContext'
function helper(t: TFunction) { ... }
```

Always add new keys to **both** files at the same time:

```typescript
// src/shared/locales/de.ts  ← Source of Truth
export const de = {
  myFeature: {
    title: 'Mein Feature',
    description: 'Beschreibung mit {name}'
  }
}

// src/shared/locales/en.ts  ← muss alle Keys aus de.ts spiegeln (TypeScript erzwingt es)
export const en: typeof de = {
  myFeature: {
    title: 'My Feature',
    description: 'Description with {name}'
  }
}
```

Keys are dot-namespaced and grouped by feature area
(`nav.*`, `settings.*`, `entry.*`, etc.). `pnpm exec node scripts/find-untranslated.mjs`
finds forgotten spots.

## Release process (maintainers only)

1. Merge stage PRs against `main` (squash).
2. Bump the version in `package.json`, add to `CHANGELOG.md`.
3. Set tag `v{X.Y.Z}`, push → GitHub Actions builds the release artifacts.
4. Publish the release notes on GitHub → the auto-updater pulls it.
