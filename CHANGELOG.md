# Changelog

All notable changes to TimeTrack are documented here.

## [Unreleased] — 2026-04-22

### Added

- **Timer** — Start/stop time entries with client + description. Running timer
  shows elapsed time in `HH:MM:SS` with a pulsing color dot and client name.
  Press Enter in the description field to start.
- **Heartbeat** — Active entries write a heartbeat every 30 seconds. On startup,
  entries with a stale heartbeat (>5 min) are automatically stopped (crash recovery).
- **Kunden-Verwaltung** — Full CRUD for clients: create with name + color picker
  (10 presets), edit inline, archive (soft-delete), and delete with confirmation.
  Archived clients are grouped separately and grayed out.
- **Global Hotkey** — `Alt+Shift+S` toggles the timer from anywhere on the system,
  even when the app window is minimized or hidden.
- **Tray Icon** — App lives in the system tray. Tooltip shows `● ClientName` while
  a timer is running, `— Kein Timer aktiv` otherwise. Right-click context menu shows
  status, "Fenster anzeigen", and "Beenden".
- **Minimize to Tray** — Closing the window hides it to tray instead of quitting.
  Quit via tray context menu or `app.quit()`.
- **SQLite database** — `better-sqlite3` with WAL mode and foreign-key enforcement.
  Stored at `%AppData%\TimeTrack\timetrack.db`.
- **Context Bridge** — Full typed `window.api` with `clients`, `entries`, and
  `settings` namespaces. `contextIsolation: true`, `nodeIntegration: false`.
- **Zustand store** — `useTimerStore` holds all timer UI state. `useTimer` hook
  manages DB interactions, tick interval, and heartbeat interval.
- **Tailwind CSS 4** — Via `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin. Dark slate theme throughout.
- **TypeScript** — Strict types shared across main + renderer via `src/shared/types.ts`.
