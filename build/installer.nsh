; #198 — release the app binary before the installer tries to replace it.
;
; A bundled MCP server runs the *installed* binary in Node mode
; (src/main/mcpLaunch.ts), so it holds TimeTrack.exe open. It is a child of an
; AI client, has no window and no tray icon, and it carries the app's own
; executable name under a foreign parent process. That combination is what
; produces "TimeTrack cannot be closed" with nothing for the user to close.
;
; electron-builder's own check cannot be relied on here. It has two branches,
; and which one runs is decided by IS_POWERSHELL_AVAILABLE — a probe that
; reported "unavailable" on a machine where PowerShell plainly works (measured
; 2026-08-03). On that branch FIND_PROCESS/KILL_PROCESS fall back to
; tasklist/taskkill by image name, and the first attempt is a WM_CLOSE that a
; windowless process ignores by definition.
;
; So we ask before anyone kills anything. src/mcp/holders.ts defines a
; plain-file handshake every MCP server watches: a shutdown request under
; <userData>/mcp-holders makes it close its transport and exit on its own,
; which the client sees as a clean end rather than a crash. Writing that
; request here gives the manually started installer the same cooperative path
; the in-app updater takes (src/main/updater.ts), and only then do we fall
; through to the built-in check for anything that did not react.
;
; Verified 2026-08-03: silent install over three live MCP servers, all three
; withdrew their own registration and the install completed untouched.

; Defining customCheckAppRunning makes electron-builder skip the block in
; allowOnlyOneInstallerInstance.nsh that provides these two — and
; _CHECK_APP_RUNNING, which we still delegate to, needs both. Without them the
; build fails with `Invalid command: "${GetProcessInfo}"`.
